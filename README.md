# terminal-ui-rs

*This project is WIP*

A rust library for creating text based UIs for the terminal as well as a window with full image and video support.

Intended for stuff like chat uis or something like a youtube client with thumbnail support but a graceful fallback to a basic terminal ui. 

## rsx

sub-crate with the intention of building jsx like uis.

Not sure whether this can actually work like I've intended.

Supposed to use the macro system of rust for creating components using a builder pattern for the parameters.
